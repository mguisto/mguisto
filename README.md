## Hello! :smiley:
### Marisa Guisto (she/her)

Hi! My name is Marisa Guisto. I am a second year Graphic Information Technology (GIT) student at ASU. Currently, I plan on getting a Master's degree in GIT with a minor in History. I'd like to work for a design firm once I graduate. 

I have experience with various Adobe products including Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro. I also have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS coding languages. 

Outside of school, I enjoy cooking, drawing, designing, and spending time with my family.
